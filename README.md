# Html-CSS-Bootstrap-Bootcamp

This repository aims to document my HTML/CSS/Bootstrap learning journey from beginner to a more proficient user. 
It highlights various fun or interesting projects that I have encountered on the Internet and Youtube.
It is more a play and practise area ranging from simple to more complex scripts.
Another added benefit is to better understand GitHub ecosystem, Raspberry Pi, Lunix, and Visual Studio Code.
